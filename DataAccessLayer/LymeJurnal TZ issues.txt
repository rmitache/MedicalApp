Problems with timezones in LymeJurnal app:


Current state (architecture) (August 2018)
	1. FE:
		- Everything works with local js time  (Date() and moment() usage)
		- When sending data to the BE, Dates are converted to UTC using toJSON()
		- When receiving data from the BE, new Date() is used (the strings from the BE are in UTC and they are converted to local time by js Date)

	2. BE and DB:
		- EF is setup to set UTC kind for all DateTimes retreived from DB 
		- Startup.cs sets JSON settings to convert everything to UTC retreived from the client 
		- MedicineFactorRecordsFactory is an exception as it generates and uses LocalTime datetime variables, using the offsetInMinutes from the client
	3. Why do we have to send UTFOffsets to the server ?
		- Answer: this is only necessary for getting FactorRecords. This is because they are generated on the fly, based on a Version's Start/End dates, as well as 
		the recurrence parameters in a Rule (ex: frequency, daysInWeek, MomentsInDay). These parameters are expressed in the Local time, else they wouldn't make sense 
		(ex: try converting mondays and thursdays to UTC right ?)

	3. Remaining issues to be answered:
		- What happens when the user has a Plan between two dates, and then proceeds to change timezone (eg. by travelling) ?
			- Wouldnt he have problems with the TakenFactorRecords somehow ? (why ? -> because they are in relative time)


Updated status (November 2018) 

	- Support for DST isnt present. It results in the version startDates being on a different UTC offset than say the other half of the date range, resulting 
	in the hard-coded UTCOffset being wrong 
	- UTCOffset has no effect on the actual times and should perhaps be removed
