Problems with timezones in LymeJurnal app:

1. Problems:
	- Although the BE is supposed to be all in UTC, we still have:
		- Some dates which are not in UTC (Ex: Plan StartDate, User.BirthDate, User.SignupDate, etc)
		- Rule Times which are supposed to be relative (untouched by TZ conversions) 
		
	- The above two cause problems with the range on the client when getting data:
		- Either missing data +1/-1 day 
		- Or showing factorRecords more than required (+1/-1 day)

2. Ideal solution:
	- Keep EVERYTHING in DB and BLL in UTC 
	- Add a City field to the UserBLO and UserCLO
		- All datetimes on the client will be shown in relation to that City TZ 
		- On the BE, Rule Times will be designated to be in the current User.City 
	- On the FE use something like CustomDateTime (or moment.tz) to:
		- Use the given timezone for all date variables 


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Current state (architecture):
	1. FE:
		- Everything works with local js time  (Date() and moment() usage)
		- When sending data to the BE, Dates are converted to UTC using toJSON()
		- When receiving data from the BE, new Date() is used (the strings from the BE are in UTC and they are converted to local time by js Date)

	2. BE and DB:
		- EF is setup to set UTC kind for all DateTimes retreived from DB 
		- Startup.cs sets JSON settings to convert everything to UTC retreived from the client 
		- MedicineFactorRecordsFactory is an exception as it generates and uses LocalTime datetime variables, using the offsetInMinutes from the client

	3. Issues today:
		- What happens when the user has a Plan between two dates, and then proceeds to change timezone (eg. by travelling) ?
			- Wouldnt he have problems with the TakenFactorRecords somehow ? (why ? -> because they are in relative time)
