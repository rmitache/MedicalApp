        <span>LymeJournal is an app for people with long-term Lyme disease. It allows you to:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule your treatments so you know what to take and when</li>
            <li>Record how you are feeling and track your symptoms</li>
            <li>Visualize your history in order to spot potential correlations, triggers, and to learn from past episodes</li>
            <li>Track your supply of supplements so you know ahead of time when you will run out</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First you need to set up your SCHEDULE. To do this start by defining your first Treatment Plan.
                There you can define which treatments you are currently on.
                While defining your Plans, you also will have to add which Supplements you are taking.
            </li>
            <li>Once you've created your first Treatment Plan, under SCHEDULE you will be able to see what you need to take every day. You can click items to mark them as taken.</li>
            <li>Under HEALTH (top left corner) you can start checking in and recording how you are feeling.</li>
            <li>You can also start tracking supply for any of your Supplements. You can do this on the top right under "Supply" by pressing the settings button and then choosing "Add supply" for the Supplements you wish to track. </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h2>History feature</h2>
        <p>Once you have enough data, you can start looking at the HISTORY page. There you can analyse your health history and:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spot possible correlations between treatments and your symptoms.</li>
            <li>Spot possible triggers when you have relapses.</li>
            <li>Look at previous episodes/relapses and understand if you are experiencing the same thing again. </li>
        </ul>
